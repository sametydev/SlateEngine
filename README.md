# Goal
In fact, the goal is to make a completely user-oriented game engine, this is already the hardest thing,
Writing a generic engine is the hardest task, but right now I don't want this engine to be for a specific area,
I want it to be a more general engine, my engines that address more specific areas will be in different repos.
SlateEngine will be a completely user friendly engine for making games.
